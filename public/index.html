						<h3>What is COVI-DL?</h3>
						<p>
							COVI-DL is a deep learning based web app for users to find out
							their chances of dying if they get Covid-19 (with 81% precision)
							based on their current pre-existing medical conditions. They can
							also find out whether or not they have Covid-19 (with 94%
							precision) based on their chest-xray.
						</p>
						<br />
						<p>
							The app uses an image of the patient's X-Ray to classify the user
							into one of 3 categories: Covid-19, Pneumonia, or Healthy and is trained 
							and deployed using Google Cloud AutoML. The Survival 
							Chance part of the app uses the patient's medical information to predict
							how likely they are to recover from	Covid-19. Trained using a regression
							neural network model.
						</p>
						<br />
						<br />
						<br />
						<p class="asterisk">
							** Regression model is created from data gathered from Mexico and
							is reflective of their population's circumstances
